  <b>Tuition Policies </b> <br><br> 
• Tuition is a continuing charge for a monthly rated class or classes.  <br>      
• Tuition payments are due on the 8th day of each month. <br> 
• Payments not received by the 12th of the month will incur a $15 late fee. <br> 
• Registration/production fees and tuition payments are non-refundable and non-transferable after the start of the semester classes. <br> 
• Tuition fees are based on the total number of instruction hours per semester (including dress rehearsals and performances) divided into 6 (fall) or 4 (spring) monthly payments. Regardless of how many classes are held per month, monthly tuition remains at a set rate.<br>   
• No tuition adjustments or credits are given for missed classes and no make-up classes will be offered, with the exception of studio-cancelled classes.  <br> 
• Classes for the semester end with the final show performance.  <br> <br> 
  
        
<b>Production Fees </b> <br><br> 
All classes that have mid or end-of-semester stage performance are charged a one-time Production Fee. Production fees cover the licensing and royalties for plays and musicals, the acquisition, creation, and maintenance of costumes, sets, and props, scripts, and publicity. Production fees are due at the time of registration in order to reserve your child’s spot in a class. <br> <br>

 <b>Withdrawal Policy </b> <br><br> 
Upon class enrollment, students are expected to complete the semester. Shows rely on the commitment of all cast members and participants to work together as a team.

No refund of prior tuition payments will be issued and any past due payment must be made at the time of official withdrawal. Showcase Cast students are subject to the withdrawal policy outlined in the Cast Agreement. Your account will remain active, until withdrawal procedures have been followed.  <br> <br>
